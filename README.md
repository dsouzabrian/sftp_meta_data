# SFTP Metadata

Python Script to read file properties in SFTP

## Installation

Install this library in a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) using pip. virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. The basic problem it addresses is one of dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.

With virtualenv, it's possible to install this library without needing system install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system dependencies.

### Windo
```bash
D:\>pip install virtualenv
D:\>virtualenv <your-env>
D:\>cd <your-env>\Scripts\activate
(<your-env>)D:\<your-env>\Scripts\>pip install pysftp
```

## Supported Python Versions
Python 3.8 is fully supported and tested. This library may work on later versions of 3, but I have not currently run tests against those versions
